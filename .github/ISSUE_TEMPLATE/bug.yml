        Everything that is related to the CalDAV server, meaning it does not only affect the web-calendar but also your mobile and desktop clients, belongs in [the Server repository](https://github.com/nextcloud/server).

        Note that Nextcloud is an open source project backed by Nextcloud GmbH. Most of our volunteers are home users and thus primarily care about issues that affect home users. Our paid engineers prioritize issues of our customers. If you are neither a home user nor a customer, consider paying somebody to fix your issue, do it yourself or become a customer.
