## Why is this so awesome?

* :rocket: **Integration with other Nextcloud apps!** Currently Contacts – more to come.
* :globe_with_meridians: **WebCal Support!** Want to see your favorite team's matchdays in your calendar? No problem!
* :raising_hand: **Attendees!** Invite people to your events.
* :see_no_evil: **We’re not reinventing the wheel!** Based on the great [davclient.js](https://github.com/evert/davclient.js), [ical.js](https://github.com/mozilla-comm/ical.js) and [fullcalendar](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar) libraries.

And in the works for the [coming versions](https://github.com/nextcloud/calendar/milestones/):
* :mag: Search for events ([#8](https://github.com/nextcloud/calendar/issues/8))
* :alarm_clock: Get alarms for events inside your browser ([#51](https://github.com/nextcloud/calendar/issues/51))
* :watch: See when other attendees are free ([#39](https://github.com/nextcloud/calendar/issues/39))

## Nightly builds

Testing is a great way to contribute without having to write source code.
Although it's straight forward, setting up the development environment requires some knowledge and extra tools on your device.

We provide [nightly builds](https://nightly.portknox.net/calendar/?C=M;O=D) to enable everyone help testing without setting up the development environment.  

1. Download
2. Extract the tar archive to 'path-to-nextcloud/apps'
3. Navigate to »Apps«, choose the category »Productivity«, find the Calendar app and enable it.

The nightly builds are provided by [Portknox.net](https://portknox.net)

When reporting issues, please mention the date in the tar archive's name.
