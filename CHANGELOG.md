Version 2.0 of the calendar has been fully rewritten with a different technology, switching from the legacy AngularJS framework to Vue.js. Nextcloud is using more and more Vue.js throughout apps and server, which makes it easy to use common components everywhere. This allows faster development and a more coherent experience in all of Nextcloud.

Even though all features present on the 1.x calendar app versions have been reimplemented, new bugs might have been introduced. Please report them if you find some.
